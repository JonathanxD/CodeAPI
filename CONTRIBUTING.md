# PRs

If you want to introduce a feature that requires a code generation, please create implementation PRs in `SourceWriter` and `BytecodeWriter` projects, it increase the chance of we merging your PR.
We don't release features before the code generation is implemented, if you don't create PRs for code generation of proposed features, we will take more time to implement the code generation, and your PR may take more time to be merged.
